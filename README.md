# FaceRecognition
This Python script uses the OpenCV library to perform real-time face detection through a webcam. The script continuously captures video from the webcam, applies face detection to each frame, and displays the video feed with green rectangles around detected faces. It allows the user to exit the program by pressing the 'q' key.
